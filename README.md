# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

# Task

- The app has all necessary tools set up (Linting, Prettier, React Testing Library etc.),
- It uses Redux for state management with sagas,
- it has a stack navigator for an onboarding flow,
- and a tab navigator. (3 screens in total)
- Onboarding flow allows user enter their name,
- - puts that in the store and persist it across sessions (when closing and re-opening the app).
- The tab navigator has one tab where it fetches users the first time that the page loades,
- - and a button to refetch users.
- **Focus is on logic**, while making the app look as good as possible given the limited time. 
- Nativewind was used for this, but you may use RNE or something similar.
