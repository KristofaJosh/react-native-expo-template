- Create a React Native app (you can use Expo if you want).
- The app should have all necessary tools set up (Linting, Prettier, React Testing Library etc.),
- It should use Redux for state management with sagas,
- it should have a stack navigator for an onboarding flow, 
- and then go to a tab navigator. (3 screens in total)
- Onboarding flow should have the user enter their name, 
- - put that in the store and persist it across sessions (when closing and re-opening the app).
- The tab navigator should then have one tab where it fetches users the first time that the page loades, 
- - and a button to refetch users. The other tab should display the name that the user entered.
- Focus on logic, but make the app look as good as possible given the limited time. (You may use RNE or something similar.)
